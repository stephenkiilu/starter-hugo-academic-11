I was a research intern at Mila Quebec AI Institute, Montrea in the last Fall of 2022. Supervised by Prof. Golnoosh Farnadi and Dr. Ulrich Aivodji. I hold two M.Sc. degrees in Mathematical Sciences and Machine Intelligence from AIMS Cameroon and AIMS Rwanda respectively (2017-2019) and a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Khartoum, Sudan.

My research include deeplearning, representatin lerning, robustness, fairness and interpretability. I am also broadly interested in unsupervised representation learning for different modalities (text, vision) and finding good disentangled representations which are generally important for good performance on some downstream tasks.

In other news, I am very passionate about ML community, teaching, learning and research. I enjoy running and traveling.
